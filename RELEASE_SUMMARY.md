## Action Required

**The GitHub Release must be created manually using one of these methods:**

### Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. Navigate to: https://github.com/smajla82-hub/7D2DBohemia/releases/new
2. In "Choose a tag", type: `v0.2.1`
3. Select "Create new tag: v0.2.1 on publish"
4. In "Target", select commit: `0f125fe5da361dd03d587ad12aa3f4933dcbf2b2`
5. Set "Release title" to: `Quest System v0.2.1`
6. Copy the content from `RELEASES/v0.2.1.md` (from PR #4) into the description
7. Ensure "Set as the latest release" is checked
8. Click "Publish release"

### Method 2: Using gh CLI

```bash
# First, push the tag
git push origin v0.2.1

# Then create the release with notes from PR #4 branch
gh release create v0.2.1 \
  --title "Quest System v0.2.1" \
  --notes-file RELEASES/v0.2.1.md \
  --target 0f125fe5da361dd03d587ad12aa3f4933dcbf2b2
```

### Method 3: Using GitHub REST API

```bash
# Fetch release notes from PR #4 branch
git fetch origin copilot/add-quest-system-documentation
NOTES=$(git show origin/copilot/add-quest-system-documentation:RELEASES/v0.2.1.md)

# Create release
curl -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/smajla82-hub/7D2DBohemia/releases \
  -d @- <<EOF
{
  "tag_name": "v0.2.1",
  "target_commitish": "0f125fe5da361dd03d587ad12aa3f4933dcbf2b2",
  "name": "Quest System v0.2.1",
  "body": $(echo "$NOTES" | jq -Rs .),
  "draft": false,
  "prerelease": false
}
EOF
```

## Expected Release Details

Once created, the release will have:

- **Release URL**: `https://github.com/smajla82-hub/7D2DBohemia/releases/tag/v0.2.1`
- **Tag**: `v0.2.1`
- **Target Commit**: `0f125fe5da361dd03d587ad12aa3f4933dcbf2b2` (PR #3 merge)
- **Release Title**: `Quest System v0.2.1`
- **Status**: Latest release
- **Artifacts**: None (as per requirements)

## Verification Checklist

After creating the release, verify:

- [ ] Tag `v0.2.1` exists on GitHub
- [ ] Tag points to commit `0f125fe5da361dd03d587ad12aa3f4933dcbf2b2`
- [ ] Release appears at https://github.com/smajla82-hub/7D2DBohemia/releases
- [ ] Release is marked as "Latest"
- [ ] Release notes are complete and properly formatted
- [ ] All permalinks in release notes work correctly
- [ ] No build artifacts are attached (as per requirements)

## Why Manual Creation is Required

The automated environment does not have:
- GitHub API authentication tokens accessible to bash/CLI tools
- `gh` CLI authentication configured
- Git credentials for pushing tags

The `report_progress` tool has internal authentication for PR operations, but it does not expose credentials for release creation or tag pushing.

## Next Steps

1. Review the release notes in `RELEASES/v0.2.1.md` from PR #4
2. Choose one of the three methods above
3. Create the GitHub Release
4. Verify using the checklist
5. Announce the release to users
